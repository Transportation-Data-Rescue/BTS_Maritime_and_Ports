In 2006, world maritime container traffic was estimated at 417 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) (loaded and empty) — 10 percent more than the 378 million TEUs transported in 2005.1 Today, one container in every nine carrying global trade is bound for or is coming from the United States, comprising 11 percent of worldwide container traffic. The year 1956 saw the United States pioneer the world's first use of containers for intermodal sea-land movements. Prior to this innovative transfer of containerized cargo between Newark, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas, finding a way to seamlessly move cargo from sea to land and land to sea was the greatest challenge for intermodal freight transportation. A \"containership revolution\" was born when it was publicly demonstrated that standard metal containers could successfully move goods on land-sea intermodal journeys. Since that first journey over fifty years ago, containers have greatly changed the movement of U.S.-international freight, port operations, and the distribution of port's share of total ocean-borne trade. They have also impacted rail and trucking operations to and from seaports, affecting traffic on the landside of these ports. From 1995 to 2006, world container traffic more than tripled in volume from 137 million to 417 million TEUs, growing at an average annual rate of about 11 percent (table 1). Expanding U.S. and global economic activity fueled this phenomenal growth in maritime container freight. With the exception of a few products, such as cars transported in specialized vessels, huge container vessels carry manufactured products of nearly every description. Although the United States remained the leading trading nation, accounting for 12 percent of total world merchandise trade in 2005 2, the United States ranked second in container traffic, a position it has held since relinquishing the number one position to China in 1998. The United States' position in container traffic directly relates to its position as the world's largest trading partner with the world's biggest economy. U.S. total imports ranked first with over 16 percent of global imports in 2005, while U.S. total exports accounted for 8.7 percent of global exports, following Germany, which was the leading exporter.

Between 1997 and 2007, U.S. exports to East Africa increased at an average annual rate of 9.1 percent per year, while imports grew by 7.7 percent. In 2007, 57 percent of U.S. trade with East Africa took place via seagoing vessel, and 22 percent by air. Trade by air has increased slightly faster than vessel trade, at average annual rates of 9.3 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. The remaining 21 percent of U.S. trade with East Africa was classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as being transported via \"other\" modes. The exports in the \"other\" category consisted mostly of U.S. shipments of airplanes to Kenya. These shipments cannot be classified as trade by air because the aircraft itself was the commodity being shipped, as opposed to being the vehicle that transports commodities."],

Between 1997 and 2007, U.S. exports to East Africa increased at an average annual rate of 9.1 percent per year, while imports grew by 7.7 percent. In 2007, 57 percent of U.S. trade with East Africa took place via seagoing vessel, and 22 percent by air. Trade by air has increased slightly faster than vessel trade, at average annual rates of 9.3 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively. The remaining 21 percent of U.S. trade with East Africa was classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as being transported via \"other\" modes. The exports in the \"other\" category consisted mostly of U.S. shipments of airplanes to Kenya. These shipments cannot be classified as trade by air because the aircraft itself was the commodity being shipped, as opposed to being the vehicle that transports commodities."],

In the inaugural edition, BTS published existing, nationally consistent measures of port capacity and throughput, and explained the criteria used to define ports and the measures used to define the top 25 ports in each category. The report included recommendations of the advisory working group to the Port Performance Freight Statistics Program (2016 Working Group), and was delivered to the BTS Director prior to publication as specified in FAST Act Section 6018. This 2017 Annual Report expands upon the first edition in several ways. The throughput and capacity statistics included in the 2016 edition have been updated with the most recently available annual data and, in many cases, have been enhanced with additional detail. This edition also expands the number of throughput and capacity measures published and incorporates new and improved methodologies. For example, a new measure of container vessel dwell times uses locational data transmitted continuously from ships, and represents the first application by BTS of automated data collection to port performance measurement."],

The report included recommendations of the advisory working group to the Port Performance Freight Statistics Program (2016 Working Group), and was delivered to the BTS Director prior to publication as specified in FAST Act Section 6018. This 2017 Annual Report expands upon the first edition in several ways. The throughput and capacity statistics included in the 2016 edition have been updated with the most recently available annual data and, in many cases, have been enhanced with additional detail.

        "dc.description":["This is the second edition of the Port Performance Freight Statistics Program Annual Report, which builds on the foundation of the 2016 Annual Report. In the inaugural edition, BTS published existing, nationally consistent measures of port capacity and throughput, and explained the criteria used to define ports and the measures used to define the top 25 ports in each category. The report included recommendations of the advisory working group to the Port Performance Freight Statistics Program (2016 Working Group), and was delivered to the BTS Director prior to publication as specified in FAST Act Section 6018. This 2017 Annual Report expands upon the first edition in several ways. The throughput and capacity statistics included in the 2016 edition have been updated with the most recently available annual data and, in many cases, have been enhanced with additional detail. This edition also expands the number of throughput and capacity measures published and incorporates new and improved methodologies. For example, a new measure of container vessel dwell times uses locational data transmitted continuously from ships, and represents the first application by BTS of automated data collection to port performance measurement. The supporting zip file contains port profile and port vicinity map datasets, a README.txt with a data dictionary, and a .json metadata file in Project Open Data format, for Port Performance Freight Statistics Program : Annual Report to Congress 2017, https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/36212 The data files are in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. The compressed zip file is 50.63 MB. These files can be unzipped using any zip decompression software. The PDF files can be opened by web browsers or with PDF readers. The README.txt file is a plain-text file and can be opened with any basic text editor. The metadata file is in .json format and can be opened with any basic text editor, but is better viewed in a metadata editor or more advance text editor, such as Notepad++."],
